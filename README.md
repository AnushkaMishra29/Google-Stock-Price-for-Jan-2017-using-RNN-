It is a Recurrent Neural Network framework with the use of LSTM to predict the google stock prices for the year 2017 and for the first financial month January. We make use of the LSTM and Dropout regualarization to create our model and then we optimize the model followed by the process of prediction for the 20 financial days of month January.
